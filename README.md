Welcome to the BTC to CZK converter!

To run this locally:

1. npm install
2. Create .env where you need to have 2 values:
    a. NEXT_PUBLIC_TATUM_TESTNET_API_KEY (you can find this in your Tatum's free account)
    b. NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL (This is the base API url )

3. After adding those 2 values you can run: npm run dev


#What could be better?
1. There could be an option to upload xPub file ad get the currect status of the
wallet balance and its current value (it would be great to handle this locally)
